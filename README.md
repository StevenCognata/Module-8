module 8 assignment for system security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company. They develop financial plans for any of their clients. They wanted us to make and deploy a web software application that made was encrpyted and secure to pass any sensitive data through the web.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  I think I did well at runing the depencty checks and understanding why this could cause vunerabilities in the software. Secure software is very important in any field but espcially when you are dealing with finances. Static testing was what I did well regarding this.
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The maven dependency check tool was the most helpful to me. It not only saved me tons of time in identifying these problems it was accurate in doing so.
 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I think in future penetration testing could be a better technique to use to further evaluate said vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I was forced to re run some of the dependency checks to check if the new ones were appearing on the check. This was also what I did to see if when I was supressing them if they were disapearing from the check. Unit testing would be the best here to make sure the functionality is working properly.
 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  I used the internet to further dive deep into some algorithms and really get a understanding of how they work under the hood. Encryption was a big topic I heavily researched, understanding how keys work etc. 
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show them my experience working with springboard and maven. Showing them that I have had minor experience with these tools can be a plus in the future.
